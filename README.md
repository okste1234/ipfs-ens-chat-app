Introducing LinkTalk, a decentralized chat application on Morph Testnet that utilizes blockchain technology and harnesses the power of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) contracts. LinkTalk is tailored for open conversations with no security concerns, allowing users to engage in transparent and p2p discussions securely on-chain.

To showcase the functionality of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) contracts, LinkTalk is deeply integrated, allowing users to easily discover and connect with others using human-readable addresses/string. This integration not only simplifies the process of finding and interacting with fellow participants but also serves as a robust testbed for the resilience and effectiveness of the ENS contract.

In LinkTalk, users can initiate and participate in conversations that are securely stored on the blockchain, leveraging the immutability and transparency of distributed ledger technology. Note, case where this conversations can be read onchain exist, therefore, conversations are tagged public, and privacy isn't the focus for now. Zero-Knowledge will be added to meter up for this on advance features level. Gasless transaction is another.

LinkTalk usecase is in open community, DAO open proposals. And, it showcase the deployed ENS contract,  a decentralized domain name system built on the Morph blockchain. Similar to how traditional domain name systems (DNS) translate human-readable website names into IP addresses, ENS converts human-readable names into Ethereum addresses, smart contract addresses. We demo showing connection with friends effortlessly, as you can easily find and communicate with them using human-readable addresses.
